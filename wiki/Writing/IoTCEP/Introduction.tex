Complex Event Systems (\textsc{Cep}) systems analyse large flows of \emph{primitive events} received from a monitored environment to timely detect situations of interest captured by \emph{composite events}, by processing \emph{user-defined rules} that specify the expected relations and interactions between observed events and the phenomena to be detected.
