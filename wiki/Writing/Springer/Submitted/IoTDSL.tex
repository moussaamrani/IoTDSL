\label{sec:IoTDSL}

Based on the challenges identified in section~\ref{sec:Motivation}, we now introduce \IOTDSL, our \DSL devoted to facilitate the high-level manipulation of \IOT systems. At the heart of \IOTDSL are two governing principles. First, we promote a clean separation of concerns for all aspects the \DSL has to handle, by specifying three sub-languages. We believe this approach to be scalable, and to support independent evolutions of each concern without impacting the other aspects, since those aspects are composed through well-defined interfaces. Second, our \DSL relies on events, a natural paradigm for specifying various models of interactions that is widely used in embedded and critical systems, and where a clear separation between the system and its environment is performed, further empowering the separation of concerns. Despite its early stage of development, \IOTDSL shows its ability to capture the definition of small-scale \IOT systems appropriately.

Building a well-calibrated \DSL is known to be difficult and error-prone. It usually requires a broad expertise of the domain under consideration before a consensus emerges on the domain's key concepts and how to effectively represent them. Fortunately, \MDE technologies operated substantial breakthrough over the past decade, allowing language designers to define their own \DSL structures and user interfaces more easily. Adopting such a trend, we have built an early prototype for our \DSL under \textit{GeMoC} \cite{bousse-16}, a \MDE framework that supports both visual and textual representations as concrete syntaxes and maintains a full synchronisation between them. Since we are at early development stage, only a textual syntax is currently available to modellers, but other syntaxes, even graphical ones, can be added smoothly thanks to \textit{GeMoc}.

To illustrate our proposal, we start by depicting the language's metamodel where we highlight its main features. We then illustrate the available constructs in \IOTDSL with the hypothetical scenario presented in section~\ref{sec:Motivation}.
