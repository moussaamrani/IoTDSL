\subsection{General Architecture}
\label{sec:CG-Architecture}

As many \IOT solutions, \IOTDSL massively relies on event processing. In order to transform abstract event definitions into runnable code, we rely on a middleware on which the event processing will run and that will be responsible for the evaluation of the rules. Figure~\ref{fig:gen-archi} depicts the general architecture of the \IOTDSL framework.
