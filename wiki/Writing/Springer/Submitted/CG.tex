\section{Code Generation}
\label{sec:CG}

We now describe how abstract event specifications are translated into a concrete technical solution and how simulation code can be generated to test the user scenarios and overall event orchestration. First, we will introduce the general architecture of the \IOTDSL technical layer, then we present the engine we have chosen to host the event processing and finally we describe the transformation of \IOTDSL rules into the chosen infrastructure.
