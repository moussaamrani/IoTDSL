\section{Motivation and Challenges}
\label{sec:Motivation}

A major issue for \IOT is the rapid growth of the offer, spanning from very simple devices (e.g., temperature, light or sound sensors) to more elaborate objects that interact with their environment (e.g. building security or multimedia solutions). For domestic usage however, it is likely that devices would have simpler capabilities, while responding to various scenarios that are specific to their inhabitants. Therefore, taming the complexity of smart homes requires handling \emph{interactions} between devices, rather than their own, specific capabilities. 

Even in this context, simple devices could be manipulated in a plethora of scenarios: for example, a sensor that reports temperature values might be paired with a heating system that regulates rooms temperature and keeps them in comfortable ranges, where in other configurations, it might detect fire situations. 

At technical level, driving such devices for realising end-users scenarios is hampered by, among others, the complexity of vendors and their proprietary data formats, the plethora of \textsc{Api}s that are quickly evolving, and the large variety of communication protocols. This overburden the work of \IOT technicians when dealing with end user requirements. Besides the need for more standardization in \IOT specifications, there is also a crucial need for abstract definition of the semantics of \IOT configurations~\cite{park-16}.

Our proposal consists of two facets. First, we clearly separate the responsibilities of  \emph{technicians} who deal with technical details relative to a specific solution deployed in a smart home, and \emph{end users}, who control the devices according to their evolving needs. Second, we offer end users a way to interact with their home at an abstract level: far from knowing how each device works, users manipulate them through abstract events describing their interactions. To this end, we propose a Domain-Specific Language (\DSL) to describe on the one hand, smart home configurations and on the other hand, events' intercommunications.

In this section, we show a typical smart home installation with affordable and simple devices. We then outline the main components of a \DSL that captures \IOT systems, and from such archetypal configuration, we list the main challenges such a \DSL for \IOT should address to effectively provide a viable solution.
