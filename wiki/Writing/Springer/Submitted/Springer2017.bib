These challenges are: a) global cooperation and standards, b) new business models and new currencies, c) ethics, control society, surveillance, consent and data driven life, and d) technological challenges driven by the need to save energy. These lead up to the urgency to co-design decision making formats that aim at finding the perfect balance between top down planning and bottom up innovation.",

	abstract="We propose SAGE, an agent-based environment monitoring and control system based on computation logic. SAGE uses forward chaining deductive inference to map low level sensor data to high level events, multi-agent abductive reasoning to provide possible explanations for these events, and teleo-reactive programming to react to these explanations, e.g. to gather extra information to check abduced hypotheses. The system is embedded in a publish/subscribe architecture.",
