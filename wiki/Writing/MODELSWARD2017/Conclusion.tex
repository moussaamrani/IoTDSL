\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

In this paper, based on recent research, we summarised the needed features as well as major challenges for the adoption of a specific language for \IOT systems. We introduced \IOTDSL, a domain specific language, designed to tackle those various challenges, \textit{e.g.} in terms of capability discovery, event processing or interoperability. In \IOTDSL, devices are described in a common \textit{Classifier} - \textit{Type} - \textit{Instance} layered specification that allows modellers to easily distinguish between typing and running instances concepts. A second benefit of that separation is the ability to create reusable \textit{libraries} of conceptual components, so \IOT devices by extension. By raising the abstraction level and hiding technical constraints to end-users, \IOTDSL is designed to serve as a handy modelling mean for them. Moreover, by abstracting the communication complexity into dedicated modelling construct, it is aimed to facilitate future evolution and re-configuration of existing solutions, since device descriptions may be retrieved from a centralized gateway.

Behavioural specifications are key aspects in \IOTDSL. We decided to rely on event-based \textit{rules} instead of state machines for their conciseness and readability, though rules may be converted to state machines automatically. Together with high-level \textit{operations} descriptions, they offer a more concise mean to describe dynamic aspects of \IOT configurations, without loosing formal model verification capabilities.

However, the prototype language is at early development stage and some features are currently missing or under development. First, the expression language must be validated on a real world examples and the mapping layer in charge of reconciling the abstract definitions and the technological APIs. Second, the complex composition of rules must be further investigated. Last, we plan to investigate on logic migration possibilities from the gateways to nodes with sufficient capacity.
